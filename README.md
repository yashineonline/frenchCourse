# French PR Accelerator (Canada) — Content-First Phase 1

Goal: go from **scratch** to a **PR-relevant French level**, optimized for **TEF Canada / TCF Canada** and **NCLC 7** (a common target for Express Entry strategies).

> This repo is a learning plan + free resources. 

---

## Why NCLC 7?
For Express Entry, strong French can:
- qualify you for **French-language proficiency draws**
- add **CRS bonus points** (commonly +25 or +50 depending on English level)

Start here:
- IRCC language tests: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/language-test.html
- CRS additional points (French): https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/check-score/crs-criteria.html

---

## Phase 1 (finish in ≤ 2 days)
By the end of Phase 1 you will have:
- A clear **target score** and **test choice** (TEF vs TCF)
- A daily routine + weekly ladder (A0 → B2/NCLC7)
- A bank of **speaking + writing templates** for exam-style tasks
- A curated list of **free** resources (TV5MONDE, RFI, YouTube)

### Do this first
1. `docs/00-START-TODAY-2H.md`
2. `docs/01-PR-TARGETS-TEF-TCF.md`
3. Start the daily routine in `docs/08-TRACKER-8-WEEKS.md`

---

## Daily routine (2 hours/day, “accelerated but sustainable”)
**20 min** — spaced repetition vocab (Anki or any SRS)  
**20 min** — pronunciation drills (record yourself)  
**40 min** — input (easy listening/reading with transcript)  
**40 min** — output (speaking/writing using templates)

If you can do 3 hours/day, add:
- +30 min “exam timed practice”
- +30 min conversation practice

---

## Week-by-week ladder (typical path to NCLC 7)
**Weeks 1–2 (A0→A1/A2):** survival French + core grammar + pronunciation  
**Weeks 3–4 (A2):** high-frequency verbs, everyday topics, short writing  
**Weeks 5–6 (B1):** longer listening + structured speaking + emails/letters  
**Weeks 7–8 (B1→B2):** debate/argumentation + timed exam tasks  
**Weeks 9–10 (B2 polish):** full mocks + feedback loop

> Reality check: “from zero to NCLC7” often takes longer than 8 weeks.
> This plan is “accelerated” by focusing on exam-aligned skills early.

## Spanish advantage
Spanish helps a lot (cognates, verb concepts, gender), but watch false friends.
