# PR Targets + TEF Canada vs TCF Canada (what to aim for)

## 1) What PR usually wants (language-wise)
For many PR paths (especially Express Entry), IRCC evaluates language via an approved test.
French tests accepted for Express Entry include:
- **TEF Canada**
- **TCF Canada**

IRCC page: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/language-test.html

Validity: results are typically valid **2 years** (verify on IRCC).

## 2) Why people target NCLC 7
NCLC 7 in all 4 skills is a common threshold for:
- French-category strategies
- CRS bonus points (often +25 or +50 depending on English)

## 3) TCF Canada format (high level)
TCF Canada includes 4 mandatory components:
- Listening
- Reading
- Writing
- Speaking

## 5) Which test should you pick?
Pick the one with:
- More test dates near you
- A format you prefer (your strengths)
- Better prep resources available to you

Rule of thumb:
- If you like structured tasks and “exam technique”, either works.
- If you want the most predictable prep path: choose the one you can book sooner + find mock tests for.
